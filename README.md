# Description

A Student Forum Web Application. We've discovered that Purdue doesn't have its own student forum. Therefore, we want to design a student forum. On which we can talk about Professors' rating, course difficulty, and daily life. 

Here are some features of HiPY:

-1. User can create new account and login.

-2. User can create a new discussion.

-3. User can write answers under any discussion.

-4. User can like or dislike any discussion or answer.

-5. User can follow a discussion.

-6. User can modify a discussion.

-7. User can search for a discussion.

-8. Any other features that may improve usability.

# Description

A Student Forum Web Application. We've discovered that Purdue doesn't have its own student forum. Therefore, we want to design a student forum. On which we can talk about Professors' rating, course difficulty, and daily life. 

Here are some features of HiPY:

-1. User can create new account and login.
-2. User can create a new discussion.
-3. User can write answers under any discussion.
-4. User can like or dislike any discussion or answer.
-5. User can follow a discussion.
-6. User can modify a discussion.
-7. User can search for a discussion.
-8. Any other features that may improve usability.
